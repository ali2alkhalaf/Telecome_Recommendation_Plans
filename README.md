# Telecome_Recommendation_Plans
# Introduction
This is a project to design a recommendation system for a telecome company. The dataset has been downloaded from kaggle using this link: https://www.kaggle.com/blastchar/telco-customer-churn/version/1

# Objective
To recommend a subscription plan to new customers of a Telecom Company
This project will help the company to best run its plansâ€™ marketing campaign and target the right customers. Then the company may increase its sales based on the recommendations from this system.

The sample has 7043 observations. I used five features to design my telecome recommendation system. These are gender, age group, partner, dependents, and plan.

These are the features that I used in my system:
Gender: Whether the customer is a male or a female
SeniorCitizen: Whether the customer is a senior citizen or not (1, 0)
Partner: Whether the customer has a partner or not (Yes, No)
Dependents: Whether the customer has dependents or not (Yes, No)
Plan: the plan is subscribed by the customer (A,B). This is encoded column. I added based on the customers subscribed plans.

I used google colabs to deal with the data and produced the recommendation system.

Files:
In this repo there are several files have been used in this project.
- customer_churn.csv is the original dataset that has been downloaded from Kaggle.
- teleco_customers_P71.csv is the file that I used to do my machine learning modeling. It has five columns from the original dataset. Also, this file has encoded features.
- Telecome_Recommendation_plans_Final is the notebook file that has the codes of my project.
